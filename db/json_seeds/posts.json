This is under construction so some things don't work correctly. Also, you have access to some things that only I should be changing, so please confine yourself to the following options:\r\n<ol><li>The team section should be working correctly. If you have the need to change information for a specific team, go right ahead. You might want to get teams to sumbit slogans\/taglines for their team. I plan on showing them at various places on the site.\r\n<li>The fights section is working too, so you can add fights. Notice that you can add a tagline for a specific show. You can also specify a second team if it's not the previous week's winner. Lastly, you can add a description that I may add. We can use this as a post show wrap up if you like.\r\n<li>The scores section is not working yet, so don't bother clicking on that link.\r\n<li>PLEASE DO NOT MESS WITH THE TEMPLATES SECTION.

Will Thursday be their first victory?\r\n\r\n<p>The stakes couldn't be higher as this marks the second match for both of these teams in the Fall Season. The winner will likely secure a place in the 2004 Winter Tournament, and still may have a chance to take out the Swarm for first place in the overall season standings (based on average votes per show). The loser may well be out of the tournament. They will battle, you will decide. See you tomorrow night!"

As such, at least one team will get a extra match.\r\n<p>\r\nFor example: This week PCR and Respecto play each other.  If Respecto wins, they now have 3 wins and PCR now has 2 losses.  Both teams will be out of the season.  Filth is left with no opponent.  Or let's say PCR beats Respecto.  They would move on to play Filth and the winner of that match would have no opponent the next week.\r\n<p>\r\nWe have decided that opponents for these extra matches will be chosen in order of votes per show rank out of the teams that are \"0-2\".  We are placing the restriction that none of the \"0-2\" teams can surpass a team that earned a win in the regular season proper in the tournament seeding.  We are also allowing for the \"0-2\" teams to pass the option to play, in which case the opportunity would go to the next highest team in votes per show.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a reminder, only 7 teams will qualify for the tournament.\r\n<p>\r\nIf any of this is confusing, feel free to ask questions using \"post comment\" below."

This process will continue every week. The challenger for each Cage will be determined by a live drawing the week before.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt the top of each CageMatch (beginning December 9) teams may register to be a part of the lottery drawing.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to register, teams must bring in a sheet of paper with the following information <b>typed<\/b> (not hand written!):<p>\r\n<p>\r\n    * TEAM NAME<p>\r\n    * NAMES OF ALL TEAM MEMBERS<p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn order for a lottery team to eligible to register, <b>all team members must have completed a UCBT Level 3b class<\/b>.

If it is determined that a winning team has one or more members who do not meet this qualification, they will be disqualified and booed.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nHarold teams and other performance groups are allowed to register as a team if they choose, or team members can register with different teams. There are no restrictions on number of players per team. However, <b>you can only register with one team each week<\/b>.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter CageMatch ends, we will have a live drawing onstage and pick one of the registered teams. <b>All team members must be present to win<\/b>. If we pick your team and one of your team members if not preset, we will throw your entry out and pick another team.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nPost a coment if you have questions, and start getting your teams together!"

Anyone can win!<p>\r\n<p>\r\nRegistration<p>\r\nThe 3x3 tourney is open to any and all participants. Simply send an email to Threeonthree@gmail.com with the following information:<p>\r\n\u2022 Player 1 (name, phone number, and email address)<p>\r\nPlayer 2 (name, phone number, and email address)<p>\r\nPlayer 3 (name, phone number, and email address)<p>\r\n\u2022 Team name<p>\r\n\u2022 Home theatre or ensemble<p>\r\n<p>\r\nAll registration emails must be received by 1pm on Friday, October 27th.<p>\r\n<p>\r\n21 teams will perform (along with 3 wildcard teams).<p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn Friday evening, you'll be emailed what slot you're team will perform in. Participants may register with ONE TEAM ONLY, so choose your lineups carefully. Your team must be able to perform on either Thursday, November 2nd, 9th, or 16th as well as Saturday, November 25th.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere is entry fee of $15 per team due when you arrive at the theatre for your qualifying slot.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Shows\r\n<p>\r\nThere will be three qualifying rounds November 2nd, 9th, and 16th at 11pm (during the regular Cage Match slot). Each qualifying round will feature eight teams \u2013 seven pre-selected groups, and one wildcard team that will be made up of audience members drawn out of a hat (or similar receptacle) that night. Each team will have seven minutes of stage time. The audience will vote for their favorite teams, and the top four teams from each week will return on Saturday, November 25th for the Semi-finals and Finals.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Semi-finals will take place on Saturday, November 25th at 8pm and 9:30pm. Each of the 6 teams will have 10 minutes of stage time to impress our panel of judges, who will be scoring the teams on a scale of 1-5 in three areas: Technical Merit, Artistry, and Comicality. The scores are then averaged to produce the team\u2019s composite score. The two teams from each show with the highest scores will compete in the Finals. There will be no wildcard teams for these shows, but there will be a Wildcard Judge for each show.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Finals will be at 11pm. Each of the 4 teams will be given 15 minutes, and scored the same way as the Semi-finals.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe prize break down for the finalists is:<p>\r\n\u2022 1st place - $160<p>\r\n\u2022 2nd place - $100<p>\r\n\u2022 3rd place - $55<p>\r\n<p>\r\nPrize amounts are not easily divisible by three to ensure healthy competition even after the shows have finished.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nRandom Notes<p>\r\n- If more than 21 teams register before 1pm on October 27th, a drawing will take place. This is will be done as fairly as humanly possible.<p>\r\n- The running order for the qualifying rounds will be determined by random drawing beforehand, with Wildcard Teams going last.<p>\r\n- The wildcard drawing is open to any audience member who wishes to throw their name into the hat (or similar receptacle), minus those individuals who are already scheduled to perform with a 3x3 team. Wildcard teams will be waived of the $15 entry fee.<p>\r\n- As in years past, the three finalist teams from the 2005 tourney will be offered automatic invites to this year\u2019s qualifying rounds.<p>\r\n- If you email threeonthree@gmail.com before 8pm the night of your slot and say the team can't make it, we will contact another team and fill your spot. If at time of show you are not present, we will add another wildcard team.<p>\r\n<p>\r\n- The tournament is \u201clong-form\u201d improv. You can only get one suggestion from the audience. No GAMEPROV.<p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nUpdates will follow, so keep checking cage-match.com as well as the Plugs forum in the IRC, but for now start emailing in your team lineups, and if you have any questions, feel free to post them here or email Threeonthree@gmail.com"

Their run ended with a loss to indie-team The Office.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2004, Respecto won 12 shows in a row starting with The Swarm and beating every house team exactly once and The Swarm twice. They also beat Shit-Storm midway through the run (the infamous \"same time\" CageMatch.) Filth beat them to end the run.\r\n<p>\r\nReuben has now won 11 shows in a row this season, needing 3 more victories to tie Optimist's record for consecutive Cage wins.  Reuben actually has 14 consecutive regular season wins right now, as they won the last three matches of the 2006 season.  This stat is somewhat marred by their loss to Hot Sauce in the 2006 tournament.\r\n"

List your team name and every member on the team.  You will not be allowed to add members once the show is booked.  You will not be penalized if someone on your team misses the show.  You should list any Thursdays that do not work for you in the email as well, as you will not be able to switch dates once your show is booked.  \r\n<br>\r\nSome notes for practice groups applying: we remain primarily interested in booking real teams that currently do shows.  Preference often goes to teams with members that regularly attend CageMatch.  Until the house team cycle is complete (in May) we will not be booking practice groups with UCB house team members. "

So if a team makes a reservation under a fake name for 10 people and one person shows up to claim a ticket from that reservation, even if they don\\'t buy all 10 tickets, that reservation will be dead.  So anyone else who shows up trying to claim the same reservation will have to go to the stand-by line.  If 10 people do show up together, then that\\'s just fine with us.\\\""

      "author": "Chuck McMahon",
      "text": "There are two policy changes for the new 2013 season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Teams may no longer call a time-out.  The \\\"time out\\\" has been used, on average, less than once a year for the past several years.  Teams have not consistently taken advantage of the time-out since around 2003.  So, while it\\'s a classic CageMatch rule, it is dying due to lack of interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. We are eliminating the pre-show coin toss.  The returning champion will go second by default.  This is how the show originally worked.  I changed the policy in 2005 to try to make the show more competitive and make it more difficult for teams to go on long runs.  This didn\\'t work.  I think going second is only a very slight advantage and rarely, if ever, affects the outcome. The main reason for changing this policy back is a practical one.  It is nice for teams to know in advance if they are going first or second so they can plan accordingly for situations where a teammate is coming from another show, etc.  If the champion wants to go first, they may ask the other team if they\\'d like to switch, and the other team can accept if they choose.  Any such switch should be confirmed with the host upon arrival.  The call time for CageMatch remains 10:30 PM for both teams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks and see you at CageMatch!\r\n"

      "text": "CageMatch is booked by Charlie Todd on a month to month basis.  All UCB house improv teams are booked as well as regularly occurring house improv shows.  Teams that win 3 Indie CageMatches are booked.  In the fall at the end of the season, there are usually 2-4 slots open.  These slots are generally filled with teams that had good seasons the year prior but were not automatically booked (and are still existing, active teams) or with other active, established teams who people tell Charlie deserve a CageMatch, usually in the backroom of McManus in the fall."
