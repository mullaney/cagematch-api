# Cagematch-api

This is the new source code for the api associated with cage-match.com, an improv show that has run in New York for nearly 20 years. The source code is provided as an example of a Ruby on Rails backend which uses ActiveAdmin as the dashboard and serves up json.

API located at: [https://cagematch-api.herokuapp.com/](https://cagematch-api.herokuapp.com/).

If you would like access to the api as a developer, let me know.
